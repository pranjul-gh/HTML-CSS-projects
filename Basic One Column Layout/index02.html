            Once there was an old farmer. he had a son. his son was very lazy. 
            He spent most of his time in eating and sleeping. he did not any work 
            at all. he grew lazier day by day.
            one day the farmer called his son and said ”look I shall give 
            everything in charity. I shall not give you anything unless you 
            earn one hundred rupees. for that, i give you three days time.
            his son went to one of his friends and borrowed a hundred rupees 
            note from him. then he spent the of the day in eating and sleeping. 
            in the evening he comes back home and gave hundred rupee note to his father.
            he told his father ” father, I have worked hard today and earned this 
            hundred rupee note. the farmer took the note and threw it aside. ”this 
            is not yours. you have not earned it, he said. the son was not angry at
            all. he just smiled and walked away.
            the next morning he again borrowed a hundred rupee note from another 
            friend and spent his time in eating And sleeping. when he returned home 
            in evening, he gave that note to his father.
