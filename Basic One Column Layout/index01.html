        <div class="content"> India is a land of ancient
            civilization. India's social, economic, and
            cultural configurations are the products of a 
            long process of regional expansion. Indian history 
            begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilizati
            on and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases a
            re usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age
            . Hinduism arose in the Vedic period. 
            The fifth century saw the unification of India under
            Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it is in 
            his reign that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia
            . In the eighth century Islam came to India for the 
            first time and by the eleventh century had firmly e
            stablished itself in India as a political force. It resulted into the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large measure of political unity. 
            It was in the 17th century that the Europeans 
            came to India. This coincided with the disintegration
            of the Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional s
            tates. In the contest for supremacy, the English em
            erged 'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58, which so
            ught to restore Indian supremacy, was crushed; and w
            ith the subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress o
            f India, the incorporation of India into the empire 
            was complete. It was followed by India's struggle for
            independence, which we got in the year 1947.
